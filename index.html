        We used computers to write and compute data back in the days. But as technology evolves, every generation tries to use their creativity to explore the unknown. 
        Video games has a huge impact to every youth who used its childhood to experience playing certain games that will surely leave a mark.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Jeepney Simulator is created by two filipino students from Davao. Joshua Renzie A. Bicoy is the lead developer, while Alvinn Vann V. Arapoc is the 3D artist of the game 
        under Spacezero Interactive. You may think of why did they create this game. As per Joshua, it is on his mind for quite some time "as a joke". But as the time goes by, 
        Alvin had the same idea and they made it into a reality. In their spare time, they usually code it and work hard for it to develop. They made a prototype immediately. 
        Since Joshua's experience involved in 2D games, it was really a challenge for him to create this one. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        They almost got their hardwork project to lose because of some strange unity error. When Alvin entered to give a helping hand, the project continued to grow as where it is today.
        Video games like this has its own ups and down and Jeepney Simulator is no exception from it. It is proven that the determination that Joshua and Alvin has it's own fruit of labor.
        Their passion for this game made them successful in finishing their demo in time.<br>
